# Sejm Votes Collector
# By Mateusz Kolinski MateuszPKolinski@gmail.com

### This project searches Polish Parliment's Webpage for all votes cast by its deputies and adds them to a database.


### Currently does not work, because Sejm website has introduced an anti-spam filter. Therefore this code needs to access API rather than the website.
